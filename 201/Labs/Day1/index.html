        <strong>It</strong> is so, hard to phantom the amount of events that have occurred in my life; and even greater, the changes that followed after.  The events are kind of like the famous inquiry, for many generations, "Did the chicken come before the egg; or did the egg come before the chicken?": and so it is with these events and changes, that have
        occurred in my life.

        <strong><i>"Never give up<strong> on a dream just because of the time it will take to accomplish it. The time will pass anyway."</i> - Earl Nightingale.  I've always wanted to be married, have a family; but it would be many years, seemingly, before I would be wed to my wife (and understandingly, now, she's a few years younger than I).  I am reminded of <i>Proverbs 5:19; and 18:22</i> when I think of my wife.  My wife<img href="https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/12144654_837366469715255_3380612445852774677_n.jpg?oh=88e2ba8bdf7f7ad1f94a698533267108&oe=59E31139"/> Christine, is one of the greatest occurences outside of salvation, that has happened in my life.  She is my rock, Whom THE Rock of my Salvation has given me.  <img href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1310777159040848&set=pb.100003257306913.-2207520000.1496762329.&type=3&theater">She is such a great Mom!  <img href="MacOS/Users/SuperCodingNinja/Documents/mom_hero.jpg"></img>Our kids think so highly of their mother; and can you blame them!

        </p>I could not ask for a greater mother, of anf for my children, than my own wife.  Christine is so, invested to our children, their smiles can last for eternity: and this is only because of GOD, Who lives in her.  When my accepted Christ, many years, ago, she had the opportunity, early on, to become a Christian, and live a life before GOD; and brings others to Christ Jesus, too!

              This little girl: no, thi young lady, has capture seemingly millions and billions by her warmth, and smile, and carisma- She's Captivating!  She's the beginning of my strength, my first-born child, my might; and she certainly is Mighty Miss Madison- aliteration!

              I am so proud of my daughter.  I believe she has overcame some incredible odds, already!  She is very, popular; and yet, at times, I see her trying to engage with the kids, and playing alone- and Praise GOD ALMIGHTY, she has a whole lot of fun doing that.  She's learning early on, you don't need the pack to be successful- you just need the right members on her team- on GOD'S team: He's the team that we all need to be on.  The one thing I want the most for my daughter, my wife, and my son, is for them to make it to Heaven: I love them so, much; and I hope to be able to do more for them: they deserve it!!!

                  Michael will carry on my family's name.  He is the last of our generations.  My son has already developed a personality that makes him both, similar to his mother and sister (and maybe me); but also very, unique, in many ways.  He is strong, like his sister, like his mother; and I pray to GOD that he is stronger than me, in every way, possible: "IT'S POSSIBLE!"

                  One thing that I also, hope for my son, is that he, and his sister, become ministers for the LORD GOD ALMIGHTY.  I pray that they do not fail GOD, like I have, in times past- we all make bad decisions/mistakes; but who doesn't want the best for their children.  It is GOD WHOM has established us; and our goings.  I am noot ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ: for it is the Power unto Salvation!!!  He is the LORD, The Truth, The Way; and The Life: JESUS IS!!!
