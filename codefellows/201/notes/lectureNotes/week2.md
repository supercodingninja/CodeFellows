Here's what I learned, thus far...

  **Ref. Course Books:

    "HTML & CSS: Designing and Building Web Sites," by Jon Ducket
    "JavaScript & jQuery: Interactive Front-End Development," by Jon Ducket

                      - ISBN-13: 978-1118907443
                      - ISBN-10: 1118907442

            - ~/supercodingninja/javascript.pdf

  The more simple you can keep your CSS, the better it is; and remember to Control Flow.**

***Week 2***
Code 201: Day 1 (DAY 6)
  **Have the <script> test.js before app.js in your HTML: because test.js will always try to run before app.js; and it will create errors if you do not run before.**
  - your code style should ALWAYS be readable.
  - your code style should inflect the style of the team.
  -when you want put a conjuction or any character that you want JavaScript to ignore, just put a \ before the character.

  **Test Driven Development (TDD)** is very important: write the code that you first want o pass; and then the behavior that you want to pass.

  **Behavior Driven Development (BDD)**

  There is no absolute truth to coding- it'shere is no absolute truth to coding is like finding out Santa Clause isn't real. like finding out Santa Clause isn't real.

  **Article of Domain**
    - Understanding the Problem Domain is The Hardest Part of Programming.
      a. It takes practice
      b.  ref. https://simpleprogrammer.com/2013/07/15/understanding-the-problem-domain-is-the-hardest-part-of-programming/

  **Functions, Objects, and Methods**
  *Example*
  var Maddie = {
    nickname: 'Maddie',
    givenName: 'Madeline',
    personality: ['fun', 'helpful', 'awesome',],
    greeting: function() {
      console.log('Hi, my name is ' + this givenName + ' but you can call me Maddy.')
      }
  }

  **The Document Object Model**
- When we talk about Domain Modeling, we talk about the attributes of domain modeling; then, the behavior, etc.
- Ch. 5 in JS book.

**Learn to implement Math.Randoms Numbers**
- it will return a zero; but never a return a 1. ref. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random "Return value a floating-point, pseudo-random number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive)."
